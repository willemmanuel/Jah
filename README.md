Jah is a location-based photo stream. It was created with college campuses in mind to give students an easy way to find out what was going on around them. Students can post images, view any postings within a 5 mile radius, and comment on content. The app was created with Tom Mignone as a way to practice mobile development, and was released to the App Store. It had modest success, being picked up by various college campuses and getting thousands of downloads.
